🏏 Cricket Win Predictor
Project Overview
Cricket Win Predictor is a machine learning-based model that predicts the probability of a team winning a cricket match based on real-time match statistics. The model analyzes key factors such as runs left, remaining balls, wickets fallen, current run rate (CRR), and required run rate (RRR) to provide accurate win probabilities.
